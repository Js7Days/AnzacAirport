a)	monitor the quality of information on computer networks

3.	Members of the Information Technology team are to monitor and evaluate business processes to ensure that these are consistent with best practice principles for data management and are responsible for approval of the 'rules' which are used to determine user access to information resources and services (though this approval can be delegated to another officer in the business area).
